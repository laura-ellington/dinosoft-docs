# Learning Guide: Further Websites for Software Projects

This guide walks you through the practical exercises for the workshop.
By the end, you will have a working documentation site for the DinoSoft
library, built with Material for MkDocs and deployed from a Codespace.

## Step 1: Create your repository

1. Go to https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/RCDS-Further-Websites
2. Click the green **Use this template** button, then **Create a new repository**
3. Give it a name (e.g. `my-dinosoft-docs`) and set it to **Public**
4. Click **Create repository**

You now have your own copy of the DinoDiet project with the DinoSoft
Python package included.

## Step 2: Open a Codespace

1. On your new repository page, click the green **Code** button
2. Switch to the **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on main**

Wait for the Codespace to build.

## Step 3: Install MkDocs Material

In the Codespace terminal, run:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

This installs MkDocs and the Material theme.

## Step 4: Scaffold the docs site

Run the MkDocs scaffolding command:

```bash
mkdocs new .
```

This creates two things:

- `mkdocs.yml` — the configuration file (in the project root)
- `docs/index.md` — a placeholder home page

Open `mkdocs.yml` in the editor. It will contain a minimal default
configuration. (Eventually, you may replace its entire contents with
the reference configuration provided at the bottom of this file)

## Step 5: Move the documentation pages into place

The repository includes pre-written `.md` documentation pages at the root
level. Move them into the `docs/` folder that MkDocs just created, but
leave `README.md` and `LEARNING.md` at the root.

Your project should now look like this:

```
├── dinosoft/
├── tests/
├── docs/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── ...
├── mkdocs.yml
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── LEARNING.md
└── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

### EXERCISE: Identifying documentation types

The content in each of these files is roughly tied to one of the
following documentation types. Can you identify which is which,
and rename the files to have more appropriate names?

- Tutorials: learning-oriented, guided experiences for newcomers
- How-to guides: task-oriented, solving a specific problem step by step
- Explanation: understanding-oriented, clarifying concepts and design decisions
- Reference: information-oriented, exhaustive technical details of your API
- Quickstarts: minimal, step-by-step setup to get running fast
- Examples: small, single-feature demos with copy-pasteable code
- Templates: full production-ready starter projects for real-world use


## Step 6: Serve the site locally

Start the live preview server:

```bash
mkdocs serve --livereload
```

A notification should appear offering to open the preview in your
browser. Click **Open in Browser** (or go to the **Ports** tab and
click the world icon).

You should see your documentation site rendered with the Material theme.
The pages will have their content but look fairly plain — just headings,
paragraphs, code blocks, and tables.

Leave `mkdocs serve` running. It watches for file changes and
automatically reloads the browser when you save.

## EXERCISE: Start improving the docs

Open any of the Markdown files in `docs/`. You will find comments
throughout, marked with `<!-- TODO: ... -->`, suggesting Material for
MkDocs features you can add. These comments are invisible in the
rendered site but visible in the editor.

Work through them at your own pace. A good order to try:

### Configure the theme (mkdocs.yml)

Open `mkdocs.yml` and start adding features. Try these first:

1. Add a light/dark colour palette toggle under `theme:`
2. Enable `content.code.copy` so code blocks get a copy button
3. Enable `navigation.tabs` to turn the top-level nav into tabs

Each time you save `mkdocs.yml`, the preview will reload with
your changes. Use the reference at the bottom of this file
for help.

### Add admonitions (callout boxes)

In `mkdocs.yml`, add the `admonition` and `pymdownx.details` extensions
under a new `markdown_extensions:` section.

Then open `docs/quickstart.md` and convert the plain-text prerequisites
note into:

```markdown
!!! note "Prerequisites"

    You need **Python 3.10** or later. Check your version with:

    `python --version`
```

Save and check the preview. Try other types: `tip`, `warning`,
`question`, `success`, `danger`, `example`.

Make some collapsible with `???` instead of `!!!`.

### Add code annotations

In `mkdocs.yml`, enable `content.code.annotate` under `theme: features:`
and add the `pymdownx.highlight` extension.

Then in any code block, add numbered annotations:

````markdown
```python
data = load_sample_data()  # (1)!
```

1. This loads the built-in dataset of 7 dinosaur species.
````

### Add content tabs

Add `pymdownx.tabbed` (with `alternate_style: true`) to your extensions.
Then in `docs/how-to.md`, convert the test suite section into tabs:

```markdown
=== "With pytest"

    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/ -v
    ```

=== "Without pytest"

    ```bash
    python -m doctest dinosoft/models.py -v
    ```
```

### Add a Mermaid diagram

Add `pymdownx.superfences` with the mermaid custom fence to your
extensions. Then in `docs/explanation.md`, replace the ASCII pipeline
with:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Data Collection] --> B[Data Analysis]
    B --> C[Data Visualisation]
    B --> D[Conclusion]
```
````

### Add MathJax formulas

Add `pymdownx.arithmatex` (with `generic: true`) to your extensions,
and add MathJax to `extra_javascript`. Then in `docs/explanation.md`,
replace the plain-text formula with:

```markdown
$$
\text{HF} = \sqrt{(\text{food_kg_per_day})^2}
$$
```

### Add icons and emoji

Add `pymdownx.emoji` to your extensions with the `twemoji` index.
Then try adding icons to your page headings:

```markdown
# :material-rocket-launch: Quickstart
```

### Set up auto-generated API docs

Install mkdocstrings:

```bash
pip install 'mkdocstrings[python]'
```

Add it as a plugin in `mkdocs.yml`. Then open `docs/reference/api.md`
and follow the TODO comment to replace the manual reference with
auto-generated docs from your Python docstrings.

### Add a grid of cards to the home page

Enable `attr_list` and `md_in_html` extensions, then replace the
bullet list on `docs/index.md` with a card grid. See the TODO comment
in that file for guidance.

## Step 7: Prepare for GitHub Pages

Now let's publish your documentation site so anyone can view it.

### 7a. Configure repository permissions

Before the workflow can deploy, you need to give Actions permission
to write to your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub (not the Codespace)
2. Click **Settings** (the tab along the top)
3. In the left sidebar, expand **Actions** and click **General**
4. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**
5. Select **Read and write permissions**
6. Click **Save**

### 7b. Create the GitHub Actions workflow

1. Go to the Material for MkDocs publishing guide:
   https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/
2. Find the GitHub Actions workflow YAML under the **GitHub Actions** section
3. In your Codespace, create a new file at `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
   and paste the workflow into it
4. Switch to the Source Control panel in the left sidebar to commit this file:

    1. Stage the `docs.yml` file with `+`
    2. Write a message (`ci: add publish workflows`)
    3. Click Commit
    4. Click Sync

### 7c. Enable GitHub Pages

Still in your repository settings:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, set the **Branch** to `gh-pages`
3. Click **Save** (if prompted)

## Step 8 Commit and Sync Your Docs

Back in your Codespace, commit all your work, again using Source Control:

1. Stage all of your files with `+`
2. Write a message (`docs: add documentation`)
3. Click Commit
4. Click Sync

### 8e. Watch it deploy

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see your workflow running — wait for it to complete
   (this usually takes 1–2 minutes)
4. Once it finishes with a green tick, go to **Settings > Pages**
5. You will see a link to your live site, something like:
   `https://your-username.github.io/my-dinosoft-docs/`

Click the link — your documentation site is now live on the internet.
Every time you push changes to `main`, the site will automatically
rebuild and redeploy.

### EXERCISE: Link Check Action

Set up a GitHub Action to run Lychee for finding broken links. Visit
the [Lychee Action repo](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)
and add the provided GitHub action to your repository.

- If you visit the Actions tab in GitHub you can manually run this action,
  but can you configure it to run on every push to `main`?
- Now it creates an issue each time it runs. You might want to remove
  the part of the Action that creates the issue if you are running it so
  often
- External links are failing with a `403`, which is common because Lychee
  is an automated-bot and getting blocked. You may want to *allow* this
  type of status code in a `lychee.toml` file at the root of your repo.
  You can also ignore certain URLs:

    ```
    accept = [200, 403]
    exclude = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost"]
    ```

## Step 9: Keep exploring

There is more you can do:

- Add front matter to pages (title, description, icon, status)
- Enable task list checkboxes with `pymdownx.tasklist`
- Add footnotes, definition lists, and abbreviation tooltips
- Set up a `nav:` section in `mkdocs.yml` with grouped tabs

The finished version of these docs (with all Material features applied)
is available from the `improve-docs` branch for reference.
